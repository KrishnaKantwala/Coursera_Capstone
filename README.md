## Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighbourhoods 

### Introduction/Business Problem section:
- The demographics of New York City indicate that it is a metropolis that is broad and ethnically diverse. It is the largest city with a long history of international immigration in the United States. In 2014, New York City was home to about 8.5 million residents, accounting for about 40 percent of the population of the state of New York and a significantly smaller proportion of the metropolitan area of New York, home to around 23.6 million. The city has been rising faster than the area over the last decade. The New York area continues to be the leading metropolitan gateway for accepted legal immigrants to the United States by far. New York City has also been an important entry point for immigrants; the word "melting pot" was coined on the Lower East Side to describe heavily populated immigrant communities.

- In New York, as many as 800 languages are spoken, making it the world's most linguistically diverse region. While there are areas in the outer boroughs in which up to 25 percent of people speak English as an alternative language and/or have little or no fluency in English, English remains the most spoken language. In communities such as Flushing, Sunset Park, and Corona, English is less spoken. With its diverse community, numerous food products are available. In New York City, there are several restaurants, each belonging to various categories, such as Chinese, Indian, and French, etc.
